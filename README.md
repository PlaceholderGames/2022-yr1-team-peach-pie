Hello to anyone reading this! You've found your way to the PeachPie repo where we will be working on our game! This team is composed of David, Dylan, Eira, Jake and Rhys! In the case you are seeing this repo without context; this is for our Games Development module! We will be working on a game with the theme of Duality. We hope to update this ReadMe with different stats; such as our Changelog, Milestones and Otherwise!
